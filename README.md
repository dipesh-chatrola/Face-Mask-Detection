# Face-Mask-DetectionðŸ˜·
The project is made to deploy Deep Learning Approach to Cater Corona Virus pandemic. I have made an project utilizing Alexnet dataset to identify the people with / without face masks. Moreover, due to GPU specificaions it was all simulated in MATLAB workspace of edition 2019b.
Until now, we have seen that many system shows high performance over images, overcoming most of the issues commonly faced in object detection in images. For real-world scenarios, it is beneficial to extend such a detection system to work over video feeds as well. So this project is fully based on live video feeds.
